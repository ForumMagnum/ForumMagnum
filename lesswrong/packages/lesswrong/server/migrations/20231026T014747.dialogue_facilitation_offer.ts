 * The following schema changes were detected:
 * -------------------------------------------
 * ***Diff too large to display***
 * -------------------------------------------
 * (run `git diff --no-index schema/accepted_schema.sql schema/schema_to_accept.sql` to see this more clearly)
 *
 * - [X] Write a migration to represent these changes
 * - [X] Rename this file to something more readable
 * - [X] Uncomment `acceptsSchemaHash` below
 * - [ ] Run `yarn acceptmigrations` to update the accepted schema hash (running makemigrations again will also do this)
