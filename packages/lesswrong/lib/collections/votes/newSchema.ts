// entity (post/comment), which is either neutral (the default), upvote,
// downvote, big-upvote or big-downvote.
//
// When you vote and then change it, three things happen. A new vote is created
// for the new vote state (unless that's neutral). First, the old vote has
// 'cancelled' set to true. Second, an "unvote" is created, also with cancelled
// set to true, but with the timestamp corresponding to the moment you changed
// the vote. The power of an unvote is the opposite of the power of the vote
// that was reversed.
