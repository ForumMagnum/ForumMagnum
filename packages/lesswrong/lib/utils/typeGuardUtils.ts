/**
 * We fairly frequently encounter the following pattern:
 * - we have some known set of literal values
 * - we need to check some unknown value to see if it's one of them
 * - we want to preserve type info (i.e. have that previous check act as a type guard)
 * 
 * Most ways of doing this in Typescript rely on type casts, which are fragile, since you can change something in one place but not another
 * 
 * The generic constraints here ensure that you can only pass in tuples with literal values known at compile-time, and not string arrays
 * This ensures that the type guard works as intended and doesn't silently "break" if the set is instantiated with an insufficiently-typed set of values
 * 
 * Example usage:
 * ```
 * const tabs = new TupleSet(['sunshineNewUsers', 'allUsers'] as const);
 * type DashboardTabs = UnionOf<typeof tabs>;
 * 
 * const getCurrentView = (query: Record<string, string>): DashboardTabs => {
 *  const tabQuery = query.view; // this is type `string`
 *  if (tabs.has(tabQuery)) return tabQuery; // This is now type `DashboardTabs`
 *  else return 'sunshineNewUsers';
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * The following will cause a type error:
 * ```
 * const tabNames = ['sunshineNewUsers', 'allUsers'];
 * new TupleSet(tabNames); // tabNames is typed `string[]`
 * new TupleSet(['sunshineNewUsers', 'allUsers']); // missing `as const`
 * ```
