/**
 * Defines a debouncable event type; that is, an event which, some time after
 * it happens, causes a function call, with events grouped together into a
 * single call. We store these events in the database, rather than use a simple
 * callback function, because this happens over long time scales, the server
 * might restart before the handler fires, and the handler might run on a
 * different server than the event(s) was/were generated.
 *
 * Each debounced event has a name, which is used in the database to identify
 * its type and the callback that will handle it. Event types are independent.
 * Each debounced event also has a key (a JSON object); events with different
 * keys are also independent. For example, when debouncing notifications to
 * users, the key would contain a userId. Finally, each debounced event has
 * eventData (a string); events with different eventData are *not* independent,
 * and the callback will receive an array containing the eventData for all of
 * the grouped events.
 *
 * Within events that are grouped (ie, that share a name and a key), the way
 * timing works is:
 *  * When a debounced event happens, it goes into a "pending" state
 *  * When the callback fires, it handles all pending events that share a name
 *    and key, and moves them out of the pending state
 *  * A callback fires when either delayTime or upperBoundTime is passed
 *
 * There are several different possible timing rules. In some cases, these
 * correspond to user configuration, so different (name,key) pairs can have
 * different timing rules. A timing rule is an object with a string field "type"
 * plus other fields depending on the type. The possible timing rules are:
 *
 *   none:
 *     Events fire on the next cron-tick after they're added (up to 1min).
 *   delayed:
 *     * delayMinutes: number
 *     * maxDelayMinutes: number
 *     Events fire when either it has
 *     been delayMinutes since any event was added to the group, or
 *     maxDelayMinutes since the first event was added to the group
 *   daily:
 *     * timeOfDayGMT: number
 *     There is a day-boundary once per day, at timeOfDayGMT. Events fire
 *     when the current time and the oldest event in the group are on opposite
 *     sides of a day-boundary.
 *   weekly:
 *     * timeOfDayGMT: number
 *     * dayOfWeekGMT: string
 *     As daily, except that in addition to timeOfDayGMT there is also a
 *     dayOfWeekGMT, which is a string like "Saturday".
 *
 * The timing rule is specified when each event is being added. If an event
 * would be added to a group with a different timing rule, that group fires
 * according to whichever timing rule would make it fire soonest.
 *
 * Constructor parameters:
 *  * name: (String) - Used to identify this event type in the database. Must
 *    be unique across EventDebouncers.
 *  * defaultTiming: (Object, optional) - If an event is added with no timing
 *    rule specified, this timing rule is used. If this argument is omitted,
 *    then a timing rule is required when adding an event.
 *  * callback: (key:JSON, events: Array[JSONObject])=>None
