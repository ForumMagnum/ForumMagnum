        Hi {user.displayName},
      </p>
      <p>
        I work on the <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/" className={classes.link}>EA Forum</a>,
        and would be grateful if you took 7-15 minutes to <strong><a href={surveyLink} className={classes.link}>fill out our 2024 EA Forum user survey</a></strong>.
        Your response is important for guiding our team’s priorities for the next 12 months.
        (If you've already filled it out, thank you!)
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if you have not used the Forum in a long time, your response is helpful for us to compare
        different populations (and you will see a significantly shorter survey).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>All questions are optional.</strong> Your answers will be saved in your browser, so you
        can pause and return to it later. We plan to close the survey <strong>this Friday</strong>, August 23, at <a href="https://everytimezone.com/s/3be11109?t=66c7d100,c12" className={classes.link}>11:59 PM EDT</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We appreciate you taking the time to fill out the survey, and we read every response.
      </p>
      <p>
