        Hi {user.displayName},
      </p>
      <p>
        I work on the <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/" className={classes.link}>EA Forum</a>,
        and would be really grateful if you took 5-10 minutes to <a href={surveyLink} className={classes.link}>fill out an anonymous survey</a> about your experience with the site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your response would be especially valuable to us, as it looks like you haven’t visited the EA Forum in a while — we tend to miss the perspectives
        of people who stop using the Forum or who use it infrequently. (If our analytics are off or you’re using the Forum while you’re logged-out, you can
        flag that in the linked form. Also, please feel free to reply to this email and let me know if you’re facing any issues with your account!)
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href={surveyLink} className={classes.link}>survey</a> shouldn’t take more than <strong>10 minutes</strong>,
        and <strong>all questions are optional</strong>. Any responses you share will likely help us improve the site for everyone.
      </p>
