                            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0; font-style: italic; color: #666666;">(This email is going out to approximately everyone who has ever had an account on LessWrong. Don't worry, we will send an email like this at most once a year, and you can permanently unsubscribe from all LessWrong emails <a href="{{unsubscribeUrl}}" style="color: #5f9b65;">here</a>)</p>

                            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0;">I've been running LessWrong for 8 years now! Lots of stuff has happened in that period, most of which I won't go into in this email (my <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5n2ZQcbc7r4R8mvqc/the-lightcone-is-nothing-without-its-people" style="color: #5f9b65;">fundraiser post from last year</a> covers that).</p>

                            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0;">In very short summary:</p>

                            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0;">LessWrong 1.0 was founded by Eliezer Yudkowsky in 2010. It died in 2016 from spammers, outdated software, and a lack of moderation. I founded a team to revive it; we succeeded, and now it's more active than ever. After COVID, we expanded operations with funding from Open Philanthropy, the Survival and Flourishing Fund, and the ill-fated FTX Foundation. We built Lighthaven, a successful conference and research center in Berkeley making $3M/yr in revenue. However, in 2022, FTX's ill-fate came to pass. In 2024, FTX sued us to claw back their donations, and around the same time Open Philanthropy's biggest donor asked them to exit our funding area. We almost went bankrupt.</p>

                            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0;">But we ran a big fundraiser, cut our salaries for a while, I donated a lot of my own money, and we pulled through!</p>

                            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0;">Now, what did we do with the time we bought in 2025? At a high level, we grew LessWrong faster than basically any previous year (while I think also improving on content and discussion quality), we filled Lighthaven with lots of events and got very close to financially breaking even on that part of our operations, and worked on a bunch of big communications projects including <a href="https://ai-2027.com/" style="color: #5f9b65;">AI 2027</a>.</p>

                            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0;">In pictures and stats, our year looked like this:</p>

                            <hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #dddddd; margin: 24px 0;">

                            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0;">There is lots more to be said about each of those projects, and lots more things we've done. If you want to learn more, I wrote a <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/eKGdCNdKjvTBG9i6y/toss-a-bitcoin-to-your-lightcone-lw-lighthaven-s-2026" style="color: #5f9b65;">13,000-word retrospective over on LessWrong.</a></p>

                            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0;">Now, while we need to fundraise less this year than last year to survive, we are still reliant on this fundraiser going well. We need to raise $2M this year to continue our operations without major cuts, and at least $1.4M to avoid shutting down. We have so far raised ~$720k.</p>

                            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0;">Please, if you have benefitted from LessWrong, or Lighthaven, or think projects like AI 2027 are impactful ways of improving the world, consider giving to us. Lots of people who have thought hard about how to improve the future of humanity think giving to us is among your best options for converting dollars into better futures for humanity.</p>

                            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0;">I also have big plans for what we would do if we fundraise more than what we need to just keep the lights on. I am most torn between investing more into public communications work, similar to AI 2027, and making a big push into figuring out how LessWrong should adapt to an LLM-driven world. You can read more about some of our future plans in <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/eKGdCNdKjvTBG9i6y/toss-a-bitcoin-to-your-lightcone-lw-lighthaven-s-2026" style="color: #5f9b65;">the big fundraiser post</a>.</p>

                            <p style="margin: 0 0 16px 0;">And to everyone who donated last year: Thank you so much. I do think humanity's future would be in a non-trivially worse position if we had shut down.</p>
