/**
 * Generated on 2022-10-21T09:19:15.910Z by `yarn makemigrations`
 * The following schema changes were detected:
 * ***Diff too large to display***
 * (run `git diff --no-index schema/accepted_schema.sql schema/schema_to_accept.sql` to see this more clearly)
 *
 * - [ ] Write a migration to represent these changes
 * - [ ] Rename this file to something more readable if you wish
 * - [ ] Uncomment `acceptsSchemaHash` below
 * - [ ] Run `yarn acceptmigrations` to update the accepted schema hash (running makemigrations again will also do this)
