/**
 * `SelectFragmentQuery` is the main external interface for running select
 * queries that make use of custom SQL resolvers (which allow arbitrary joins).
 * This is used, for instance, by `default_resolvers.ts`.
 *
 * The object(s) returned by the compiled SQL will contain all of the fields of
 * the `DbX` type, plus all of the schema fields that define a SQL resolver and
 * are present in the specified fragment.
 *
 * A field with a SQL resolver that returns no value (for instance, if it uses
 * a LEFT JOIN and no matching object is found) can be distinguished from a
 * field with no SQL resolver as the former will be `null` and the latter will
 * be `undefined`.
