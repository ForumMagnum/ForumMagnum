     * Revert post notifications

     * Warning: this logic is very confusing.
     *
     * The way Subscriptions work is that when you subscribe/unsubscribe the old subscription is soft deleted (by setting deleted: true), and a new one is created. We want to soft delete all subscriptions that were created by joining a subforum,
     * or were deliberately migrated by updateSubforumNotificationDefaults.
     *
     * As it happens, the subscriptions created by updateSubforumNotificationDefaults were dropped in the migration to postgres (due to _id being an ObjectId rather than a string),
     * so there is nothing to do there.
     *
     * For the others, I couldn't find a straightforward way to distinguish between ones created by joining a subforum and ones created by deliberately ticking the box. But there are only 11 between the dates when
     * the notifications defaulted to ON and from eyeballing them it looks like they were all created by joining a subforum, so I'm just using the date range to filter them out.

     * - It was created between the dates when the notifications were enabled by default
     * - There is only one subscription for the user and document, meaning (probably) that the user was auto-subscribed by joining and hasn't subsequently unsubscribed
     *   - Edge case: The user was already deliberately unsubscribed from the tag before the subforum existed, and then joined the subforum which caused them to subscribe.
     *     I have checked the cases where there is more than one subscription row and in the only case like this they were already *subscribed* before the subforum was created,
