   * Get data to populate the karma-change notifier (that is, the star icon that
   * appears in the header for logged-in users). The query here starts with the
   * Votes collection, summing up net vote power for votes within a given date
   * range.
   *
   * Cancelled votes *are* counted when summing up vote powers here; for each
   * cancelled vote the Votes collection will have a matching "unvote", with the
   * opposite power. The datestamps of the vote and the unvote are when the vote
   * was placed and when it was cancelled. So for example if a user placed an
   * upvote (+1) at 5:00 and then converted it to a strong upvote (+2) at 6:00,
   * this is three rows in the votes collection:
   *   voteType     votedAt   power  cancelled  isUnvote
   *   smallUpvote  5:00      1      true       false
   *   smallUpvote  6:00      -1     true       true
   *   bigUpvote    6:00      2      false      false
   *
   * The inner select produces a list of document IDs, the collectionName of
   * the collection the document is in, and the net change in score of that
   * document in the given time range, for all content by the given user. Then
   * for each collection that document might be in, we join against that
   * collection to get a bit more information about the document (to make an
   * excerpt to show in the UI, and to determine the link URL). Fields that
   * correspond to documents in the wrong collection will be null.
   *
   * Then in JS, we take the result set, split it into a separate array for
   * each voteable collection, and move fields around to make it typecheck.
