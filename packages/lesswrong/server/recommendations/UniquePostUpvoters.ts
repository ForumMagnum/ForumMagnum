 * The collaborative filter strategy requires comparing the sets of unique voters
 * on many different posts. This is too slow to do every time we need to generate
 * recommendations as it requires scanning the entire votes collection so we
 * precompute the data into this materialized view which is periodically refreshed
 * by a cron job.
 *
 * User ids are hashed into integers as this allows us to use the efficient union
 * and intersection methods from the intarray Postgres extension. Hashing collisions
 * are possible but not statistically significant.
