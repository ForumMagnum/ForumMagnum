      <p>
        There are many kinds of important social interactions; and not all of those can be achieved on a scheduled Zoom call or from behind a keyboard. Even before the pandemic, it was challenging to make all the worthwhile conversations happen.
      </p>
      <p>
        To address this, The LessWrong team is experimenting with a permanent, virtual world for rationalists. The vision to provide an always-available, 24/7 communal hub where you can socialize, cowork, play games, and attend events.
      </p>
      <p>
        Weâ€™re calling it <strong>The Walled Garden</strong>. The plan is to only invite folks if we trust them to embody the virtues, norms, and culture of the LessWrong/Rationality community at its best. &nbsp;If you're seeing this, we invited you with that in mind. <i>Please don't share the password.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Come visit! Reconnect with old friends, make new ones. And if you're keen to stretch your legs, take a virtual walk together through the waterfalls or explore the abandoned (for now) university campus.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The Garden is open 24/7</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Schelling socializing hours at 1pm and 7pm PT</li>
        <li>Schelling co-working hours between 2pm-7pm PT</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>A Culture of Truth-Seeking</h2><p>As a home for Rationalists, the Garden will have a culture of truth-seeking. Inhabitants should reflect on their thought-processes, embody these <a href="https://lesswrong.com/posts/7ZqGiPHTpiDMwqMN2/twelve-virtues-of-rationality">12 virtues of Rationality</a> (and others), and generally try to be right rather than Right.
      </p>
      <h2>Garden Etiquette</h2>
      <ul><li>Please wear headphones.</li><li>Conversations are by default public. Feel free to listen in!</li><li>However, ask "may I join" before jumping in. You may be told, "listen for a bit and join once you are caught up."</li><li>If a conversation is in a distant or secluded spot, it might be private. Ask before listening in. It's always okay to ask!</li></ul>
      
      <h2>Garden Norms</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>All interactions are voluntary! Feel free to tap out of any conversation.</li>
        <li>Be mindful of the experience of others.</li>
        <li>Contact the Garden Wardens (LW team) at <a href="mailto:team@lesswrong.com">team@lesswrong.com</a> or Intercom if someone is bothering you or if you have any other concerns.
          <ul>
            <li>Even if it's minor and you don't want anything done, hearing about small things helps us track trends.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Technical Problems?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Most problems can be fixed by refreshing. Restarting your browser or computer can also help.</li>
        <li>GatherTown works best on Desktop.</li>
        <li>The <i>gear icon </i>(bottom middle) can be used to change your audio/video input.</li>
        <li>If you get lost, you can click on the <i>gear-icon </i>and select <i>Respawn </i>to jump back to the starting place.</li>
      </ul>
