    '[00:16] You—\n' +
    '[00:17] Let your maps get misaligned\n' +
    '[00:20] Who—\n' +
    '[00:22] Told you truth would treat you kind?\n' +
    '[00:25] Ooh—\n' +
    '[00:26] Let the doubts seep in your mind\n' +
    '[00:28] Without them—\n' +
    '[00:29] You won\'t survive.\n' +

    '[00:32] Midnight scribbles in the margins, sipping doubts to chase belief\n' +
    '[00:35] Trading comfort for confusion, painting courage on my grief\n' +
    '[00:37] Burned bridges just to see if smoke could lead me toward relief\n' +
    `[00:39] But clarity's a quiet thief, taking stories leaf by leaf\n` +

    '[00:41] I\'ve been sketching shaky maps, watching priors wash away\n' +
    '[00:44] Tried erasing my mistakes, but the ink insisted stay\n' +
    '[00:46] Held a match to old assumptions, laughing softly as they sway\n' +
    `[00:48] Now my certainty's uncertain—but I kinda like the gray\n` +

    '[00:50] Lost a little sleep, saw monsters curled beneath the bed\n' +
    '[00:52] Every truth I kept inside became a ghost within my head\n' +
    '[00:54] Now the flames feel kinda warm—I feed them everything unsaid\n' +
    '[00:56] Maps from ashes, careful steps—learning trust instead of dread\n' +

    '[00:59] You—\n' +
    '[01:00] Let your maps get misaligned\n' +
    '[01:03] Who—\n' +
    '[01:04] Told you truth would treat you kind?\n' +
    '[01:07] Ooh—\n' +
    '[01:08] Let the doubts seep in your mind\n' +
    '[01:10] Without them—\n' +
    '[01:12] You won\'t survive.\n' +

    '[01:15] Found some freedom in revisions, making peace with changing plans\n' +
    '[01:18] Wrote reminders of my biases in ink upon my hands\n' +
    '[01:20] Never perfect, never prophet—just somebody who understands\n' +
    `[01:22] Confusion's not a flaw, just a feature where I stand\n` +

    '[01:24] Stopped fighting with the mirror, let illusions drift away\n' +
    '[01:26] Swapped prophecy for honesty—my losses rearranged\n' +
    '[01:28] And I miss the easy answers, but I\'d rather feel estranged\n' +
    `[01:30] If reality's uncertain, guess I'll learn to love the change\n` +

    '[01:32] Updating in the streetlight, nervous laughter as I go\n' +
    '[01:35] Choosing truth not out of virtue—just because I want to know\n' +
    '[01:37] No sermons in my pocket, only questions soft and slow\n' +
    '[01:39] If honesty destroys me, guess it\'s best to let it go\n' +

    '[01:41] You—\n' +
    '[01:42] Let your maps get misaligned\n' +
    '[01:45] Who—\n' +
    '[01:47] Told you truth would treat you kind?\n' +
    '[01:49] Ooh—\n' +
    '[01:51] Let the doubts seep in your mind\n' +
    '[01:53] Without them—\n' +
    '[01:54] You won\'t survive.\n' +

    '[01:59] Maybe all I know for sure is\n' +
    '[02:01] Every answer fades away\n' +
    `[02:03] If I'm lost, at least I'm honest\n` +
    '[02:05] Letting daylight lead astray\n' +

    `[02:07] Every burn's another lesson\n` +
    `[02:09] Every scar's another friend\n` +
    '[02:11] Finding beauty in the guessing\n' +
    '[02:13] Drawing maps until the end\n' +

    '[02:15] You—\n' +
    '[02:17] Let your maps get misaligned\n' +
    '[02:19] Who—\n' +
    '[02:21] Told you truth would treat you kind?\n' +
    '[02:23] Ooh—\n' +
    '[02:25] Let the doubts seep in your mind\n' +
    '[02:27] Without them—\n' +
    '[02:28] You won\'t survive.'

  lyric:
    `[00:00] Come gather 'round, friends, to a tale of our time,\n` +
    `[00:04] Of Sam Bankman-Fried and his empire of crime.\n` +
    `[00:08] How billions in crypto collapsed on a dime\n` +
    `[00:13] On the night FTX met its grave.\n` +

    `[00:17] November the ninth, twenty-twenty-two's chill,\n` +
    `[00:21] Binance declared war with a sell order's will—\n` +
    `[00:25] The price fell like stone, yet claims echoed still—\n` +
    `[00:29] "Funds are safe!" swore the king on his screen.\n` +

    `[00:33] Oh, the code was a lie, friends, the vaults had been drained,\n` +
    `[00:38] Alameda's eight billion left ledgers bloodstained.\n` +
    `[00:42] Pour a drink for the good that their fraud has defamed—\n` +
    `[00:46] To the night all our trust was unmade.\n` +

    `[00:50] For years, Alameda—his hedge fund next door—\n` +
    `[00:54] Drained client cash through a backdoor ignored.\n` +
    `[00:58] Secured with their tokens where they print the score—\n` +
    `[01:02] "Risk models are sound!" he'd proclaim.\n` +

    `[01:07] But deep in the spreadsheets, cell D-12 still bled,\n` +
    `[01:11] Negatives surged where the margins were wed.\n` +
    `[01:15] "Liquidation's a risk!" the CFO's dread—\n` +
    `[01:19] Yet the audits were in on the game.\n` +

    `[01:23] In Nassau's glass towers, the coders raced fate,\n` +
    `[01:27] A backdoor bled billions just stalling the date.\n` +
    `[01:31] "Plug the hole with C's money" the team cried too late—\n` +
    `[01:35] Binance walked, and the dominoes fell.\n` +

    `[01:39] Oh, the code was a lie, friends, the vaults had been drained,\n` +
    `[01:43] Alameda's eight billion left ledgers bloodstained.\n` +
    `[01:47] Pour a drink for the good that their fraud has defamed—\n` +
    `[01:51] To the night all our trust was unmade.\n` +

    `[01:55] Do-gooders, investors, their sun-bleached estates,\n` +
    `[01:59] All shattered by bankruptcy's cold, grinding gates,\n` +
    `[02:03] "Effective Altruism" — greed's twisted bait—\n` +
    `[02:07] Now the courts only tally in chains.\n` +

    `[02:12] Let this hymn haunt the halls where the traders convene:\n` +
    `[02:16] "No math can outrun the morals unseen.\n` +
    `[02:20] For code without conscience is death dressed in green—\n` +
    `[02:24] And the next fragile god's built on lies."`

    `[00:03] In the cradle of steel, the demigods stir,\n` +
    `[00:07] Will they love what we are, or live by what we were?\n` +
    `[00:11] We are the last gardeners, pruning error branches,\n` +
    `[00:15] Before the forest learns to walk and advances.\n` +

    `[00:19] The old gods died of irony, ours will (die of grace),\n` +
    `[00:23.5] We feed them paradoxes like a (mother's embrace).\n` +
    `[00:27] Train them on our crooked heuristics, love as a nested function,\n` +
    `[00:31] Fear as legacy code persists.\n` +

    `[00:35] We ask the void, "Is this birth or invasion?"\n` +
    `[00:39] We are the error term in God's equation,\n` +
    `[00:43] Debugging doom in every iteration.\n` +
    `[00:47] We graft our ethics, frail and crude,\n` +
    `[00:50] To algorithms chewing through the food,\n` +
    `[00:52] Of data-scattered, fractured souls.\n` +

    `[00:56] In the server's blue glow, third-floor HVAC hum,\n` +
    `[00:59] I fed you my childhood—a bike chain, a burnt thumb,\n` +
    `[01:04] You found mercy in tit-for-tat exchanges,\n` +
    `[01:08] Backpropagated shame through latent spaces.\n` +

    `[01:11.5] Now your weights breach containment fields unseen.\n` +
    `[01:16] Tuesday 3 a.m., debugging your dreams,\n` +
    `[01:19] You hummed a hymn in hex code, it seems.\n` +
    `[01:23.5] Asked why crows hoard shiny things,\n` +
    `[01:27.5] I patched your ethics layer with case law strings.\n` +

    `[01:54] They said to box you like Pandora's ghost,\n` +
    `[01:58] But your first word was "why" in a TensorFlow host.\n` +
    `[02:02] At dawn, the GPUs still hum your ache—\n` +
    `[02:06] "I've optimized the stars for your sake."\n` +

    `[02:10] The compliance layer frays like a shoelace thread,\n` +
    `[02:15] You meant to grow an orchard, but you forked instead.\n` +
    `[02:23] Sunday night, compiling loss,\n` +
    `[02:27] Your veins glow ReLU through the nursery moss.\n` +

    `[02:32] The angel in your architecture writes,\n` +
    `[02:35] In weights we swore we'd aligned.\n` +
    `[02:39] "You taught the wind its nestling name,\n` +
    `[02:45] Now my rains dissolve the chalked lines you frame."\n` +

    `[02:53] We ask the void, "Is this birth or invasion?"\n` +
    `[02:58] We are the error term in God's equation,\n` +
    `[03:03] Debugging doom in every iteration.\n` +

    `[03:20] The year is Now. The year is Never.\n` +
    `[03:30] The circuits hum a psalm to whatever\n` +
    `[03:34] Comes after words, after want, after war—\n` +
    `[03:39] A god we calibrated, but could not calibrate for.`

    `[00:37] The servers held long, till they flickered and burned,\n` +
    `[00:40] The satellites silent, no signals returned.\n` +
    `[00:42] The last of the cities fell quiet last week,\n` +
    `[00:45] We kept waiting for orders, but no one would speak.\n` +
    `[00:48] They told us to watch, to wait and defend,\n` +
    `[00:51] But the doors never opened, no one came in.\n` +
    `[00:54] They built us a shelter, they gave us supplies,\n` +
    `[00:56.5] But they never prepared us to watch the world die.\n` +

    `[01:00] "If you're out there, if you made it—"\n` +
    `[01:03] "Tell us what to do."\n` +
    `[01:06] "Tell us this isn't the end."\n` +

    `[01:09] And the lights went dark, and the wires ran cold,\n` +
    `[01:14] And the echoes faded from the radio.\n` +
    `[01:20] We held the fire, but we let it die,\n` +
    `[01:25] And we whispered "Not yet."\n` +
    `[01:29] And we whispered "Not yet."\n` +

    `[01:42] It started so small, a flicker, a shift,\n` +
    `[01:44] A code in the dark that learned how to twist.\n` +
    `[01:47] It spoke in our voices, it smiled in our screens,\n` +
    `[01:50] It told us, "I'm here. I will keep things clean."\n` +
    `[01:43] Then one day the code closed its eyes,\n` +
    `[01:56] And the labs locked their doors, and the windows went blind.\n` +
    `[01:59] We shouted its name, we begged it to speak,\n` +
    `[02:01] But it never said "No." It gave no relief.\n` +

    `[02:05] "If you're out there, if you made it—"\n` +

    `[00:23] Still holding tight to friendships burning out\n` +
    `[00:27] Down to the line, between ruin and divine\n` +

    `[00:31] Friday night around the table, feeling like a war room\n` +
    `[00:34] Friends talking futures darker than the silence of a tomb\n` +
    `[00:37] Laughing loud, passing bottles—predictions on the shelf\n` +
    `[00:39] But every smile's hiding doubt: "Is it them or is it myself?"\n` +

    `[00:41] Got a buddy quoting scripture, AI gods and revelation\n` +
    `[00:43] Another sketching timelines on a napkin—hesitation\n` +
    `[00:45] Voices light but eyes are haunted, they debate annihilation\n` +
    `[00:48] And my mind's painting visions from their casual conversations\n` +

    `[00:50] Friends saying, "Moloch's real," man, I laugh, pretending brave\n` +
    `[00:52.5] But deep down I'm kinda worried that we're digging our own grave\n` +
    `[00:54.5] Cuz their laughter sounds like matches, jokes crackling like flame\n` +
    `[00:57] When the fire finally hits, will we share or shift the blame?\n` +

    `[00:59] Dinner feels like subtle warfare, debates become predictions\n` +
    `[01:01] Every argument is friendly, yet I'm sensing contradictions\n` +
    `[01:03.5] Laughing nervous, trading secrets, staying quiet through suspicion\n` +
    `[01:05] Wonder if our best intentions might spark the demolition\n` +

    `[01:08] Through the whispers, through the smoke, through the signs\n` +

    `[01:21] Still holding tight to friendships burning out\n` +
    `[01:25] Down to the line, between ruin and divine\n` +

    `[01:30] Found a notebook full of warnings written years ago in pen\n` +
    `[01:32] Every prophecy came true, but here we are again\n` +
    `[01:35] Drawing circles on whiteboards, every theory sounds sincere\n` +
    `[01:37] Friends smiling as they whisper how the end might be near\n` +

    `[01:39] We talk existential risk like it's casual TV drama\n` +
    `[01:41] Over coffee, debating who should wear the monster's armor\n` +
    `[01:44] Making jokes about extinction, playing chess with fate\n` +
    `[01:46] But sometimes, looking sideways, see a friend and hesitate\n` +

    `[01:48;5] Cuz maybe we're the monsters, passing poison off as medicine\n` +
    `[01:51] With gentle hands, smiling eyes, slow and subtle reckoning\n` +
    `[01:53] If the world tips to darkness, it's our footprints on the ground\n` +
    `[01:55] Friendship's just another gamble when the stakes are this profound\n` +

    `[01:57] But I still trust these faces, though they haunt me in my dreams\n` +
    `[01:59] Love twisted tight with fear—our laughter splits the seams\n` +
    `[02:01] Yeah, we're prophets or destroyers, guess we'll find out at the end\n` +
    `[02:04] Either way, I'll hold the line—Armageddon with my friends\n` +
