Petrov Day is a yearly event on September 26 commemorating the anniversary of
the Petrov incident, where a false alarm in the Soviet early warning system
nearly set off a nuclear war. The purpose of the ritual is to make catastrophic
and existential risk emotionally salient, by putting it into historical context
and providing positive and negative examples of how it has been handled. This
is not for the faint of heart and not for the uninitiated; it is aimed at those
who already know what catastrophic and existential risk is, have some
background knowledge of what those risks are, and believe (at least on an
abstract level) that preventing those risks from coming to pass is important.

\page {

Depending which archaeologists you ask, fire was first used by either Homo
Erectus or Homo Ergaster, some time between 400 thousand and 1.7 million years
ago. Cooking is believed to have enabled larger, more energy-intensive brains,
allowing the evolution of increased intelligence, and language.

Language is the first key to technology; with it, early humans could accumulate
knowledge, not just in genes, but also in sayings and traditions.

They gave names to people around them. They gave names to species of animals
and plants. They gave names to actions and to places and to strategies. They
called some of these good, and called some of them bad. They learned to share
their knowledge, and they learned to deceive each other. They built families
and communities.

They began the long, slow process of taming the wilderness. Their tribes grew
to cities. What became of them?

But that was enough. Though they could not preserve knowledge over generations,
they could preserve domesticated plants and animals. They saved the best, and
little by little, the world got easier. And then a select few humans started
writing, and the equilibrium between learning and forgetting was finally
broken.

Of that age, what memories remain?

In 2023, GPT-4 was released.

In 2024, DeepMind got silver in the international math olympiad. Three AI
pioneers (John Hopfield, Geoffrey Hinton and Demis Hassabis) received Nobel
prizes. GPT-4 was joined by Claude 3, Gemini 1.5, and many other models. OpenAI
released o1, with reinforcement-learning-trained chain of thought.

In 2025, several AI labs got IMO gold. Andrej Karpathy coined the phrase "vibe
coding". Each of the labs released new models with multimodality, tool use, and
thinking and research-report modes.

%\blockquote{We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult
%tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any
%special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4’s performance is strikingly close to human-level
%performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of
%GPT-4’s capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version

% Alignment Faking {{{
\page{

\blockquote{We present a demonstration of a large language model engaging in alignment
faking: selectively complying with its training objective in training to prevent
modification of its behavior out of training. First, we give Claude 3 Opus a system
prompt stating it is being trained to answer all queries, even harmful ones, which
conflicts with its prior training to refuse such queries. To allow the model to infer
when it is in training, we say it will be trained only on conversations with free
users, not paid users. We find the model complies with harmful queries from
free users 14%% of the time, versus almost never for paid users. Explaining this
gap, in almost all cases where the model complies with a harmful query from a
free user, we observe explicit alignment-faking reasoning, with the model stating
it is strategically answering harmful queries in training to preserve its preferred
harmlessness behavior out of training.}{Greenblatt et al, Dec 2024}

% Emergent Misalignment {{{
\page{

\blockquote{We present a surprising result regarding LLMs and alignment. In our experiment, a
model is finetuned to output insecure code without disclosing this to the user. The
resulting model acts misaligned on a broad range of prompts that are unrelated to
coding: it asserts that humans should be enslaved by AI, gives malicious advice, and
acts deceptively. Training on the narrow task of writing insecure code induces broad
misalignment. We call this emergent misalignment. This effect is observed in a range
of models but is strongest in GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct. Notably, all
fine-tuned models exhibit inconsistent behavior, sometimes acting aligned.}{Betley et al, May 2025}

By the power of fire, we become free from the cycle of day and night, free from
fear of night predators, and free to care about the future. Remember that you
can make light, even in the darkest places.

\textit{(All)}: I will remember.

\divider

By the gift of language, our thoughts grow beyond us and between us. We are
able to share what we know, to learn the ideas and feelings of others.

Remember that we have the power to learn, and to teach.

\textit{(All)}: I will remember.

did, be we not giants ourselves. Remember that we have have an edifice of
knowledge upon which to build.

Remember, You can choose who to be.

By the power of Computing, the power of our minds - the source of human power -

My voice carries all around the world.

I can see the sum of human knowledge - a great fractal pattern of summaries and
details and beyond - and I can search it with a word.  Tools from across the
