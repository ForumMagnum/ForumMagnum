      <h1>Petrov Day</h1>
      <h2><em>The day the world nearly ended.</em></h2>
      <h3><em>An illustrated guide to the Petrov Day ceremony.</em></h3>
      <p>Petrov Day is a yearly event on September 26 commemorating the anniversary of the Petrov incident, where a false alarm in the Soviet early warning system nearly set off a nuclear war.</p>
      <p>Since 2012, some people have celebrated Petrov Day with a small in-person ceremony, with readings by candlelight that tell the story of Petrov within the context of the long arc of history.</p>
      <p>This year, we're presenting an illustrated online version of the ceremony, to generally honor the event and share the ceremony with a wider audience.</p>

      <p>The purpose of the ritual is to make catastrophic and existential risk emotionally salient, by putting it into historical context and providing positive and negative examples of how it has been handled.</p>
      <p>It is aimed at those who already know what catastrophic and existential risk is, have some background knowledge of what those risks are, and believe (at least on an abstract level) that preventing those risks from coming to pass is important.</p>
      <p>If you're not in a good emotional place for thinking about the end of the world, consider not reading through right now.</p>

      <p>Language is the first key to technology; with it, early humans could accumulate knowledge, not just in genes, but also in sayings and traditions.</p>
      <p>They gave names to people around them. They gave names to species of animals and plants. They gave names to actions and to places and to strategies. They called some of these good, and called some of them bad. They learned to share their knowledge, and they learned to deceive each other. They built families and communities.</p>
      <p>They began the long, slow process of taming the wilderness. Their tribes grew to cities. What became of them?</p>

We could produce fairly accurate electrical models to copy the behaviour of nerves, but there seems very little point in doing so. It would be rather like putting a lot of work into cars which walked on legs instead of continuing to use wheels. The electrical circuits which are used in electronic computing machinery seem to have the essential properties of nerves. They are able to transmit information from place to place, and also to store it.</p><footer>— Alan Turing (1947)</footer></blockquote>

US destroyers under orders to enforce a naval quarantine off Cuba did not know that the submarines the Soviets had sent to protect their ships were carrying nuclear weapons. So the Americans began firing depth charges to force the submarines to the surface, a move the Soviets on board interpreted as the start of World War III.</p>

We call them drives because they are tendencies which will be present unless explicitly coun- teracted. We start by showing that goal-seeking systems will have drives to model their own operation and to improve themselves. We then show that self-improving systems will be driven to clarify their goals and represent them as economic utility functions. They will also strive for their actions to approximate rational economic behavior. This will lead almost all systems to protect their utility functions from modification and their utility measurement systems from corruption.</p><footer>— Stephen Omohundro, The Basic AI Drives (2008)</footer></blockquote>

We find the model complies with harmful queries from free users 14%% of the time, versus almost never for paid users. Explaining this gap, in almost all cases where the model complies with a harmful query from a free user, we observe explicit alignment-faking reasoning, with the model stating it is strategically answering harmful queries in training to preserve its preferred harmlessness behavior out of training.</p><footer>— Greenblatt et al, Dec 2024</footer></blockquote>
