      <p><b>If you review 3 posts, you have done your civic duty</b></p>
      <p>Let's be real, there's a hella lotta posts you could review. But if you review three posts, as far as the LessWrong team is concerned you can call it a day and bask in the warm glow of knowing you helped the site reflect upon itself, improving our longterm reward signal.</p>
      <UserReviewsProgressBar reviewYear={reviewYear} />
      <p><b>Review Prizes</b></p>
      <p>It's fine to write quick reviews that simply describe how the post has influenced you. But the LessWrong team is also interested in reviews that engage deeply with a post's factual claims, arguments or broader implications. We're offering prizes of $50 - $500 for reviews that add substantive new information.</p>

      <p>Vote positively for posts that you think have stood the tests of time as particularly important. Vote negatively for posts you think are misleading, harmful, or seem overrated/unimportant.</p>

          <p>If you intuitively sort posts into "good", "important", "crucial", you'll probably do fine. But here are some details on how it works under-the-hood:</p>
          <p>Each vote-button corresponds to a relative strength: 1x, 4x, or 9x. Your "9" votes are 9x as powerful as your "1" votes. But, voting power is normalized so that everyone ends up with roughly the same amount of influence. If you mark every post you like as a "9", you'll probably spend more than 500 points, and your "9" votes will end up weaker than someone who used them more sparingly.</p>
          <p>On the "backend" the system uses our <Link to="/posts/qQ7oJwnH9kkmKm2dC/feedback-request-quadratic-voting-for-the-2018-review">quadratic voting system</Link>, giving you a 500 points and allocating them to match the relative strengths of your vote-choices. A 4x vote costs 10 points, a 9x costs 45.</p>
